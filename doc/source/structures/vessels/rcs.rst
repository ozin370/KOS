RCS
======

Some of the Parts returned by :ref:`LIST PARTS <list command>` will be of type RCS. It is also possible to get just the RCS parts by executing ``LIST RCS``, for example::

    LIST RCS IN myVariable.
    FOR rcs IN myVariable {
        print "An rcs thruster exists with ISP = " + rcs:ISP.
    }.

.. note::

    A :struct:`RCS` is a type of :struct:`Part`, and therefore can use all the suffixes of :struct:`Part`.

.. attribute:: RCS:ENABLED

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`Boolean <boolean>`
    
    Is this rcs thruster enabled.
    
.. attribute:: RCS:ENABLEYAW

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`Boolean <boolean>`
        
    Is yaw control enabled for this rcs thruster.
    
.. attribute:: RCS:ENABLEPITCH

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`Boolean <boolean>`
        
    Is pitch control enabled for this rcs thruster.
    
.. attribute:: RCS:ENABLEROLL

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`Boolean <boolean>`
        
    Is roll control enabled for this rcs thruster.
    
.. attribute:: RCS:ENABLEFORE

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`Boolean <boolean>`
        
    Is fore/aft control enabled for this rcs thruster.
    
.. attribute:: RCS:ENABLESTARBOARD

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`Boolean <boolean>`
        
    Is port/starboard control enabled for this rcs thruster.
    
.. attribute:: RCS:ENABLETOP

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`Boolean <boolean>`
        
    Is dorsal/ventral control enabled for this rcs thruster.
    
.. attribute:: RCS:FOREBYTHROTTLE

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`Boolean <boolean>`
        
    Does this thruster apply fore thrust when the ship throttled up.
    
.. attribute:: RCS:FULLTHRUST

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`Boolean <boolean>`
        
    Does this thruster always apply full thrust.
    
.. attribute:: RCS:THRUSTLIMIT

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (%)

    If this is a thruster with a thrust limiter (tweakable) enabled, what
    percentage is it limited to?  Note that this is expressed as a
    percentage, not a simple 0..1 coefficient.  e.g. To set thrustlimit
    to half, you use a value of 50.0, not 0.5.

    This value is not allowed to go outside the range [0..100].  If you
    attempt to do so, it will be clamped down into the allowed range.

    Note that although a kerboscript is allowed to set the value to a
    very precise number (for example 10.5123), the stock in-game display
    widget that pops up when you right-click the rcs will automatically
    round it to the nearest 0.5 whenever you open the panel.  So if you
    do something like ``set ship:part[20]:thrustlimit to 10.5123.`` in
    your script, then look at the rightclick menu for the rcs, the very
    act of just looking at the menu will cause it to become 10.5 instead
    of 10.5123.  There isn't much that kOS can do to change this.  It's a
    user interface decision baked into the stock game.

.. _rcs_MAXTHRUST:

.. attribute:: RCS:MAXTHRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    How much thrust would this rcs thruster give at its current atmospheric pressure if one of the control axes that activates it (yaw, pitch, roll, fore, aft, or top) was maxxed, and the thrust limiter was max at 100%.  Note this might not be the thruster's actual max thrust it could have under other air pressure conditions.  Some thrusters have a very different value for MAXTHRUST in vacuum as opposed to at sea level pressure.

.. _rcs_MAXTHRUSTAT:

.. method:: RCS:MAXTHRUSTAT(pressure)

    :parameter pressure: atmospheric pressure (in standard Kerbin atmospheres)
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    How much thrust would this rcs thruster give if one of the control axes that activated it (yaw, pitch, roll, fore, aft, or top) was maxxed and thrust limiter was max at the given atmospheric pressure.  Use a pressure of 0.0 for vacuum, and 1.0 for sea level (on Kerbin) (or more than 1 for thicker atmospheres like on Eve).
    (Pressure must be greater than or equal to zero.  If you pass in a
    negative value, it will be treated as if you had given a zero instead.)

.. attribute:: RCS:THRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    How much thrust is this rcs thruster is giving at this very moment.

.. _rcs_AVAILABLETHRUST:

.. attribute:: RCS:AVAILABLETHRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    Taking into account the thrust limiter tweakable setting, how much thrust would this rcs thruster give at its current thrust limit setting and atmospheric pressure conditions, if one of the control axes that activated it (yaw, pitch, roll, fore, aft, or top) was maxxed .

.. _rcs_AVAILABLETHRUSTAT:

.. method:: RCS:AVAILABLETHRUSTAT(pressure)

    :parameter pressure: atmospheric pressure (in standard Kerbin atmospheres)
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    Taking into account the thrust limiter tweakable setting, how much thrust at the given atmospheric pressure would this rcs thruster give at its current thrust limit setting if one of the control axes that activated it (yaw, pitch, roll, fore, aft, or top) was maxxed.   The pressure is measured in ATMs, meaning 0.0 is a vacuum, 1.0 is sea level at Kerbin.
    (Pressure must be greater than or equal to zero.  If you pass in a
    negative value, it will be treated as if you had given a zero instead.)

.. attribute:: RCS:MAXFUELFLOW

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (units/s)

    How much fuel volume would this rcs thruster consume at standard pressure and velocity if one of the control axes that activated it (yaw, pitch, roll, fore, aft, or top) was maxxed, and the thrust limiter was max at 100%.  Note this might not be the engine's actual max fuel flow it could have under other air pressure conditions.

.. attribute:: RCS:MAXMASSFLOW

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (Mg/s)

    How much fuel mass would this rcs thruster consume at standard pressure and velocity if one of the control axes that activated it (yaw, pitch, roll, fore, aft, or top) was maxxed, and the thrust limiter was max at 100%.  Note this might not be the engine's actual max fuel flow it could have under other air pressure conditions.

.. attribute:: RCS:ISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>`

    `Specific impulse <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specific_impulse>`_

.. method:: RCS:ISPAT(pressure)

    :parameter pressure: atmospheric pressure (in standard Kerbin atmospheres)
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>`

    `Specific impulse <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specific_impulse>`_ at the given atmospheric pressure.  Use a pressure of 0 for vacuum, and 1 for sea level (on Kerbin).
    (Pressure must be greater than or equal to zero.  If you pass in a
    negative value, it will be treated as if you had given a zero instead.)

.. attribute:: RCS:VACUUMISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>`

    Vacuum `specific impulse <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specific_impulse>`_

.. attribute:: RCS:VISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>`

    Synonym for :VACUUMISP

.. attribute:: RCS:SEALEVELISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>`

    `Specific impulse <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specific_impulse>`_ at Kerbin sealevel.

.. attribute:: RCS:SLISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>`

    Synonym for :SEALEVELISP

.. attribute:: RCS:FLAMEOUT

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`Boolean <boolean>`

    Is this rcs thruster failed because it is starved of a resource (monopropellant)?

.. attribute:: RCS:THRUSTVECTORS

    :access: Get only
    :type: :struct:`List` of :struct:`Vectors <Vector>`

    This gives a list of all the vectors that this RCS module can thrust along. Vectors returned are of unit length.  The vectors are returned in Ship-Raw coordinates, rather than relative to the ship.  (i.e. if it thrusts along the ship's fore axis, and the ship's current ``ship:facing:forevector`` is ``V(0.7071, 0.7071, 0)``, then the value this returns would be ``V(0.7071, 0.7071, 0)``, not ``V(0,0,1)``).

.. attribute:: RCS:CONSUMEDRESOURCES

    :access: Get only
    :type: :struct:`Lexicon` of :struct:`CONSUMEDRESOURCERCS`

    This gives a lexicon of all the resources this rcs thruster consumes, keyed by resource name.
